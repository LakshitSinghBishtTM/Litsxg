# Non-Roadmap

This document defines what does not exist for Litsxg.

There is no roadmap.
There will not be one.
This is intentional.

---

## Overview

Most software publishes a roadmap to signal growth.

Litsxg explicitly rejects this model.

The absence of a roadmap is a design decision, not an omission.

---

## Design finality

Litsxg is finished.

This means:
- core design is complete
- protocol is fixed
- trust model is fixed
- threat model is fixed

There is no planned evolution.

---

## No feature roadmap

There are no planned features.

This includes:
- no new commands
- no new modes
- no new clients
- no new platforms
- no optional components

Requests for features are out of scope.

---

## No security roadmap

There is no security roadmap.

This includes:
- no encryption upgrades
- no authentication hardening
- no metadata protection
- no anonymity expansion

Security properties are final and documented.

---

## No scalability roadmap

There is no scalability roadmap.

This includes:
- no clustering
- no replication
- no load balancing
- no horizontal scaling

Scale is limited by operator infrastructure.

---

## No usability roadmap

There is no usability roadmap.

This includes:
- no UX improvements
- no guidance layers
- no onboarding
- no error explanations

Usability is fixed at its current level.

---

## No compatibility roadmap

There is no compatibility roadmap.

This includes:
- no backward compatibility guarantees
- no version negotiation
- no long-term client/server coexistence

Compatibility is operator-managed.

---

## No deprecation plan

Nothing will be deprecated.

Features are either:
- present and permanent
- absent and permanent

There is no transition period.

---

## No milestones

There are no milestones.

There is no:
- “next release”
- “major version”
- “future phase”

Time does not imply change.

---

## Handling future requests

Future requests will be evaluated against this document.

If a request implies:
- expansion
- softening
- abstraction
- protection

It will be declined.

---

## Operator expectations

Operators must adopt Litsxg as it is.

Choosing the tool means accepting:
- immobility
- limits
- finality

Waiting for change is incorrect.

---

## Scope enforcement

This document overrides any implied future direction.

Nothing is planned beyond maintenance.

---

## Final statement

Litsxg has no future plans because it does not need them.

Stability comes from refusal to evolve.
