# No-Bloat Policy

This document defines the no-bloat policy for Litsxg.

Minimalism is not a preference.
It is a constraint.
Bloat will not be introduced.

---

## Overview

Litsxg is intentionally small.

The tool includes only what is required for:
- message routing
- basic identity continuity
- operator interaction

Anything beyond this is considered bloat.

---

## Definition of bloat

In the context of Litsxg, bloat includes:

- feature flags
- optional subsystems
- configuration layers
- plugins or extensions
- abstraction frameworks
- background services
- compatibility shims

Bloat is any addition that expands scope without necessity.

---

## User interface bloat

The client interface will not include:

- popups
- banners
- notifications
- onboarding flows
- tooltips
- status dashboards

The interface reflects state without commentary.

---

## Protocol bloat

The protocol will not include:

- version negotiation
- extension points
- optional commands
- backward compatibility layers

The protocol is closed and final.

---

## Security feature bloat

Security-related features that are out of scope include:

- encryption layers
- key management systems
- authentication hardening
- audit frameworks

Adding these would change the tool’s identity.

---

## Operational bloat

Litsxg will not include:

- orchestration logic
- clustering support
- replication mechanisms
- auto-scaling
- health endpoints

Operations are external.

---

## Configuration bloat

Configuration is intentionally limited.

The tool will not include:
- dynamic configuration reload
- layered configuration files
- environment-driven behavior matrices

Behavior is fixed at build time or startup.

---

## Dependency bloat

Dependencies are kept minimal.

Litsxg avoids:
- large frameworks
- runtime-heavy libraries
- indirect dependency chains

Dependency growth is treated as risk.

---

## Documentation bloat

Documentation exists to define boundaries, not expand scope.

Documentation will not:
- promise future features
- imply extensibility
- soften constraints

Documentation reflects reality only.

---

## Feature request handling

Feature requests that introduce bloat will be declined.

This includes requests framed as:
- optional
- configurable
- disabled by default

Optional bloat is still bloat.

---

## Permanence of policy

The no-bloat policy is permanent.

It will not be relaxed.
It will not be revisited.

---

## Operator responsibility

Operators must accept:

- fixed behavior
- lack of customization
- absence of comfort features

Choosing Litsxg implies accepting this policy.

---

## Scope enforcement

Anything not explicitly included is excluded.

Absence is intentional.

---

## Final statement

Litsxg remains small by refusing to grow.

This is not negotiable.
