# TL;DR

Stop here.

This tool is not designed to be understood quickly,
used casually,
or evaluated safely through a summary.

If you are looking for:
- a quick overview
- guarantees
- reassurance
- safety claims
- recovery promises
- explanations during failure

you are not the intended operator.

Litsxg is deliberately minimal, explicit, and unforgiving of assumptions.
It will do exactly what is documented, and nothing more.
It will not warn you when you misuse it.
It will not protect you from incorrect expectations.

The documentation exists to describe boundaries, not to make them comfortable.

If you continue reading, you do so as an operator who accepts responsibility
for deployment, operation, and consequences.

There is no shorter version.
