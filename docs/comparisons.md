# Comparisons

This document compares Litsxg to other classes of messaging tools.

The purpose is boundary clarification.
This is not marketing.
No equivalence is implied.

---

## Overview

Litsxg is frequently misclassified.

Comparisons are provided only to prevent incorrect assumptions.
They are not endorsements or critiques of other tools.

---

## Litsxg vs secure messengers

Examples of secure messengers include tools that provide:
- end-to-end encryption
- integrity protection
- metadata minimization
- key management

Litsxg does not provide these.

Key differences:
- Litsxg messages are plaintext
- the server can read and modify messages
- no cryptographic guarantees exist

These tools are designed for adversarial environments.
Litsxg is not.

---

## Litsxg vs Signal-like systems

Signal-like systems emphasize:
- strong cryptography
- forward secrecy
- deniability
- safety by default

Litsxg emphasizes:
- explicit behavior
- operator responsibility
- minimalism
- transparency of limits

They solve different problems.

---

## Litsxg vs email

Email systems typically provide:
- store-and-forward delivery
- message persistence
- decentralized routing

Litsxg provides:
- live routing
- volatile buffering
- centralized server control

Email prioritizes durability.
Litsxg does not.

---

## Litsxg vs IRC

IRC systems provide:
- plaintext messaging
- centralized servers
- minimal protocol complexity

Similarities exist.

Differences include:
- Litsxg uses Tor by default
- Litsxg has explicit authentication flow
- Litsxg has no channels or rooms

Litsxg is not an IRC replacement.

---

## Litsxg vs modern chat platforms

Modern chat platforms typically provide:
- rich user interfaces
- message history
- moderation tools
- analytics
- notifications

Litsxg provides none of these.

The absence is intentional.

---

## Litsxg vs research prototypes

Research systems often include:
- experimental features
- evolving threat models
- unstable semantics

Litsxg does not.

Litsxg is a finished tool with fixed behavior.

---

## Litsxg vs frameworks or libraries

Frameworks and libraries exist to be extended.

Litsxg does not.

It is a closed tool with no extension points.

---

## Misleading comparisons

Comparisons that are incorrect include:
- treating Litsxg as a secure messenger
- treating Litsxg as anonymous communication
- treating Litsxg as a platform

Such comparisons result in misuse.

---

## Operator guidance

Operators should choose Litsxg only if:

- plaintext messaging is acceptable
- server trust is acceptable
- loss is acceptable
- minimalism is preferred

If not, another tool is more appropriate.

---

## Scope enforcement

This document does not imply feature parity.

Absence of a feature is not a deficiency.
It is a boundary.

---

## Final statement

Litsxg exists in a narrow space.

Comparisons are useful only to avoid misunderstanding that space.
