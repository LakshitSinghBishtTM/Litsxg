# Conclusion

This document closes the Litsxg documentation set.

Nothing new is introduced here.
Nothing is softened.
This is a restatement of finality.

---

## What Litsxg is

Litsxg is a tool for operator-to-operator messaging.

It is:
- plaintext
- server-trusted
- Tor-transported
- minimal
- production-grade
- finished

It does exactly what is documented.

---

## What Litsxg is not

Litsxg is not:
- a secure messenger
- an anonymous system
- a platform
- a framework
- an evolving product
- a safety-oriented system

Expecting otherwise is misuse.

---

## Design closure

All major design decisions are closed.

This includes:
- protocol semantics
- trust boundaries
- failure behavior
- upgrade policy
- no-bloat policy
- non-roadmap

There is no pending work.

---

## Responsibility model

Responsibility is explicit.

The operator is responsible for:
- deployment
- trust decisions
- data handling
- failure acceptance
- correct usage

The tool does not absorb responsibility.

---

## Documentation role

Documentation in Litsxg exists to:

- define boundaries
- remove ambiguity
- prevent false assumptions

Documentation does not provide comfort.
It provides clarity.

---

## When to use Litsxg

Litsxg is appropriate only if:

- plaintext messaging is acceptable
- server trust is acceptable
- message loss is acceptable
- minimalism is preferred
- operator discipline exists

If any of these are unacceptable, choose another tool.

---

## When not to use Litsxg

Do not use Litsxg if you require:

- confidentiality guarantees
- integrity guarantees
- anonymity against the server
- reliability guarantees
- future evolution

The tool will not change to meet these needs.

---

## Finality statement

Litsxg is complete.

There is no roadmap.
There are no promises.
There is no migration path.

What exists now is what will exist.

---

## Final statement

Litsxg does not try to be safe.
It tries to be clear.

Understanding it fully is mandatory.
Using it correctly is the operator’s responsibility.
