# Contributing

This document defines the contribution policy for Litsxg.

Contribution is allowed.
Direction is fixed.
Not all contributions will be accepted.

---

## Overview

Litsxg is free and open source.

Contributions are accepted only if they align strictly with the existing design.
The project is not open-ended.

---

## What contributions are welcome

The following contributions may be considered:

- bug fixes that correct deviations from documented behavior
- portability fixes
- build system fixes
- documentation corrections or clarifications

All contributions must preserve existing semantics.

---

## What contributions are not welcome

The following contributions will not be accepted:

- new features
- security enhancements beyond documented claims
- cryptographic changes
- protocol extensions
- UI improvements
- configurability additions
- performance optimizations that alter behavior

These are out of scope.

---

## Design non-negotiables

Contributions must not change:

- plaintext protocol
- trust model
- threat model
- no-bloat policy
- upgrade policy
- stability policy

Violating any of these is grounds for rejection.

---

## Contribution process

Contributions should:

- be minimal
- be narrowly scoped
- include a clear explanation
- reference relevant documentation

Large or sweeping changes are discouraged.

---

## Code style and clarity

Contributions must prioritize:

- clarity over cleverness
- explicit behavior
- minimal dependencies

Rewriting for style alone is discouraged.

---

## Documentation contributions

Documentation contributions are encouraged.

They must:
- reflect actual behavior
- avoid aspirational language
- avoid implying future changes

Documentation must remain cold and explicit.

---

## Review expectations

There is no guaranteed review timeline.

Reviews may be:
- delayed
- minimal
- declined without explanation

Silence does not imply acceptance.

---

## Ownership and direction

Project direction is maintained by the author.

Contribution does not imply influence over roadmap or design.

---

## License agreement

All contributions must be compatible with the project license.

Contributors agree their work is distributed under the same license.

---

## Scope enforcement

If a contribution is not explicitly allowed here, it is not allowed.

This policy is final.

---

## Final statement

Contributions are welcome only when they preserve the tool as it is.

Litsxg is not a platform for experimentation.
