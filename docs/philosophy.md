# Philosophy

This document describes the philosophy behind Litsxg.

Philosophy here is descriptive, not aspirational.
It explains why the tool is the way it is.
It does not argue for change.

---

## Overview

Litsxg exists to be explicit.

It does not attempt to:
- impress
- reassure
- protect by abstraction
- hide consequences

Its philosophy is grounded in restraint.

---

## Explicitness over comfort

Litsxg favors explicit behavior over comfort.

This means:
- no hidden safeguards
- no silent correction
- no softened failure modes

Operators see the system as it is.

---

## Minimalism as constraint

Minimalism in Litsxg is not aesthetic.

It is a constraint that:
- limits assumptions
- reduces ambiguity
- prevents scope creep

Features are excluded deliberately.

---

## Honesty about limits

Litsxg is explicit about what it does not do.

This includes:
- security guarantees
- reliability guarantees
- anonymity guarantees

Honesty is preferred over implication.

---

## Trust is not abstracted

Litsxg does not attempt to remove trust.

The server is trusted.
The operator is trusted.
The environment is trusted.

If trust is unacceptable, the tool is unsuitable.

---

## Failure is normal

Failure is treated as a normal operating condition.

This includes:
- message loss
- disconnections
- crashes
- restarts

Failure is visible and unmasked.

---

## No future promises

Litsxg does not promise evolution.

There is:
- no roadmap
- no planned upgrades
- no transition to stronger guarantees

The design is final.

---

## Operator-centric design

Litsxg is designed for operators, not end users.

Assumptions include:
- technical competence
- willingness to read documentation
- acceptance of responsibility

The tool does not guide or protect.

---

## Tool, not platform

Litsxg is a tool.

It is not:
- a framework
- a platform
- an ecosystem
- a base for extension

It is complete as-is.

---

## Free and open source, not permissive

GPLv3 was chosen deliberately.

Freedom here means:
- inspectability
- modifiability
- redistribution under the same terms

It does not mean permissiveness.

---

## What this philosophy rejects

This philosophy rejects:
- security theater
- feature accumulation
- user hand-holding
- abstraction of consequences
- silent complexity

These are considered risks.

---

## Operator responsibility

The philosophy places responsibility on the operator.

Understanding the tool is mandatory.
Misuse is not prevented.
Consequences are externalized.

---

## Final statement

Litsxg exists to be clear, small, and final.

Its philosophy is restraint, not ambition.
